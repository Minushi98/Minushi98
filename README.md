👋 Hi, I’m @Minushi98

👀 I’m interested in web development, programming, and creating engaging digital content.

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and working on projects like a 'Flappy Bird' game to enhance my skills.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, especially those involving front-end design and JavaScript.
